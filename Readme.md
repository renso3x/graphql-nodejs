# Deliverables:

### React Native/Expo app using Apollo GraphQL:

- As an app user, I should be able to view, create and delete a task. The task can be as simple as a date/time and a note.
- BONUS: The layout has header, footer and buttons using CareLuLu's layout
- BONUS: Users can sign up/log in/log out and tasks are linked to users (i.e. users can only view, create and delete their own tasks).

### Nodejs/Koa/Apollo Server API:

- The API should expose GraphQL endpoints to list, create and delete tasks.
- Migration code or sql script to prepare and seed a MySQL database.
- BONUS: The API exposes sign up and log in endpoints and tasks are linked to users.

### Guidelines:

- We generally expect candidates to spend 10-20 hours on this project, but feel free to spend more or less. However, let me know if you're spending more than 30 hours on this, it shouldn't take that long.

- Please write code as you'd be doing for a real project. As you can see, the actual functionality is very simple, so the more robust you design your project, the more points you will receive. For example, logging, error handling, database models and other systems all count towards evaluating how much knowledge you have.
